<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I’m Bala Murali Krishna, a passionate DevOps Engineer and Full Stack Web
  Developer with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and automated
  systems. I enjoy bridging the gap between development and operations by
  implementing CI/CD pipelines, containerized deployments, and cloud-native
  solutions that enhance reliability and speed.
</p>

<p>
  hands-on experience in technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, AWS, and
  Azure, I design robust infrastructures that support continuous integration and
  seamless deployment. On the development side, I specialize in Flask-based
  applications, crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces backed
  by secure APIs and optimized databases.

<p>
  thrive on solving complex challenges, whether it’s automating cloud workflows,
  improving system performance, or developing end-to-end web solutions that make
  an impact. My ultimate goal is to create reliable, maintainable, and
  high-performance software ecosystems that empower both teams and users.
